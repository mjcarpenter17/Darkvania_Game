## 1.3 Layer Management Panel

### Layer List Display

- [ ] Layer type indicators

### Layer Controls
- [x] Visibility and lock system
  - [x] Eye icon toggle for layer visibility (clickable)

- [ ] Drag-and-drop layer reordering

### Data Integration
- [x] Proper layer data management in memory
- [x] Save/load layer properties (e.g., visibility/lock) in JSON format
- [x] Maintain backward compatibility with existing save files

## 1.4 Zoom and Navigation Controls

### Zoom System Implementation
- [x] Ctrl+Mouse Wheel for zoom (step-based) toward cursor position
- [x] Zoom levels: 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%, 150%, 200%, 300%, 400%, 600%, 800%
- [x] Maintain zoom level when switching tools or panels

### Toolbar Zoom Controls
- [x] Zoom In/Out buttons adjust one step
- [x] Zoom dropdown allows direct selection of zoom level
- [x] Fit to Window calculates optimal zoom to show entire map
- [x] Actual Size button sets zoom to exactly 100%

### Navigation Improvements
- [x] Middle mouse button drag for smooth panning
- [x] Arrow keys for panning
- [x] WASD keys continue to work for movement
- [x] Page Up/Down for larger jumps
- [x] Home key to center view on map origin

### Visual Feedback
- [ ] Grid visibility adapts to zoom level (hide when too small)
- [x] Pixel-perfect rendering at 100% zoom
- [x] Smooth scaling at all zoom levels
- [x] Current zoom percentage shown in status bar

### Performance Considerations
- [x] Efficient viewport culling (only render visible tiles)
- [x] Smooth zoom/pan performance acceptable
- [x] Proper canvas clipping/limits at all zoom levels
- [ ] Memory-efficient handling of very large maps

---

## Integration Tasks

### Code Organization
- [ ] Refactor further: break down main loop into panel-specific components/classes
- [ ] Maintain clean separation between UI and data logic
- [ ] Add proper error handling for all new features

### Backward Compatibility
- [x] All current features continue to work
- [x] Existing save files load correctly

- [x] No regression in responsiveness observed

### User Preferences
- [x] Save panel sizes and positions
- [x] Remember zoom level between sessions
- [ ] Store toolbar layout preferences
- [x] Maintain/persist layer visibility states
