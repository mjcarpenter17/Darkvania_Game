# Enhanced Splitter System Documentation

## Overview
The enhanced splitter system provides professional-grade visual feedback for all panel resizing operations in the tile editor. This system makes the resizing functionality highly discoverable and provides clear visual cues during interaction.

## Features

### 1. Visual Feedback States
**Hover State:**
- Light blue highlight (80, 170, 255) when mouse hovers over splitter zones
- Resize cursor automatically changes to indicate draggability
- Status bar tooltip shows function ("Drag to resize tileset panel width")

**Active Dragging State:**
- Bright blue highlight (120, 200, 255) during active dragging
- Enhanced visual feedback to confirm user interaction
- Immediate visual response to drag operations

**Default State:**
- Subtle gray line for minimal visual interference
- Always visible but non-intrusive when not in use

### 2. Splitter Types and Locations

**Left Splitter (Tileset Panel):**
- Location: Between tileset panel and main canvas
- Function: Adjusts tileset panel width
- Drag Direction: Horizontal (left/right)
- Status Bar Help: "Drag to resize tileset panel width"

**Right Splitter (Properties Panel):**
- Location: Between main canvas and properties panel
- Function: Adjusts properties panel width
- Drag Direction: Horizontal (left/right)
- Status Bar Help: "Drag to resize properties panel width"

**Right Inner Splitter (Layer/Properties Split):**
- Location: Between layers panel and properties panel (horizontal)
- Function: Adjusts height ratio of layer vs properties panels
- Drag Direction: Vertical (up/down)
- Status Bar Help: "Drag to resize layer/properties panel heights"

### 3. Visual Indicators

**Resize Icons:**
- Dotted patterns indicate drag direction
- Vertical dots for horizontal splitters
- Horizontal dots for vertical splitters
- Bright white color (240, 245, 250) for high visibility

**Hit Zones:**
- 8-pixel wide zones for easy targeting
- Collision detection optimized for smooth interaction
- Zone boundaries defined for precise control

### 4. Technical Implementation

**State Management:**
```python
self.splitter_hover = None      # Current hovered splitter
self.splitter_zones = {}        # Hit detection rectangles
self.splitter_active = None     # Currently dragging splitter
```

**Visual Feedback Loop:**
```python
def draw_splitter_handles(self):
    # Dynamic color selection based on state
    is_hovering = splitter_rect.collidepoint(mx, my)
    is_dragging = self.drag_[splitter]_split
    
    color = (120, 200, 255) if is_dragging else (80, 170, 255) if is_hovering else subtle_gray
```

**Mouse Interaction:**
- Real-time hover detection with immediate visual feedback
- Precise hit zone calculation for reliable interaction
- Cursor changes to resize indicator over splitter zones
- Status bar updates with contextual help text

### 5. User Experience Benefits

**Discoverability:**
- Clear visual indication that panels are resizable
- Immediate feedback reduces guesswork
- Professional appearance matches modern applications

**Precision:**
- 8-pixel wide hit zones accommodate various motor skills
- Visual feedback confirms successful targeting
- Smooth dragging with real-time updates

**Accessibility:**
- High contrast colors for visibility
- Clear cursor changes for interaction feedback
- Descriptive status bar help text

### 6. Integration with Existing Systems

**Menu System:**
- Splitter functionality accessible through View menu
- Reset options available for panel layouts
- Consistent with overall professional UI design

**Preferences System:**
- Splitter positions can be saved/restored
- Default layout preferences available
- Consistent with application-wide settings

**Event Handling:**
- Integrated with existing mouse handling system
- Proper event priority to avoid conflicts
- Smooth coordination with other interactive elements

## Code Structure

### Core Methods
- `draw_splitter_handles()`: Main visual rendering
- `handle_mouse_click()`: Drag initiation
- `handle_mouse_motion()`: Hover detection and drag updates
- `handle_mouse_up()`: Drag completion

### State Variables
- `splitter_hover`: Current hovered splitter name
- `splitter_zones`: Dictionary of collision rectangles
- `splitter_active`: Currently dragging splitter
- `drag_[position]_split`: Individual drag states

### Visual Constants
- Hover Color: (80, 170, 255) - Light blue
- Active Color: (120, 200, 255) - Bright blue
- Default Color: (120, 120, 120) - Subtle gray
- Icon Color: (240, 245, 250) - Bright white

## Professional Standards

This enhanced splitter system meets professional application standards by providing:
- Immediate visual feedback for all interaction states
- Clear affordance indicators showing interactive elements
- Consistent behavior across all splitter types
- Accessibility considerations for various user needs
- Integration with overall application UI patterns

The system transforms the previously subtle splitter functionality into a discoverable, professional-grade feature that matches the quality expectations of commercial tile editing applications.
