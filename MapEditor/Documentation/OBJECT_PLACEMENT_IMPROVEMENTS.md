# Map Editor Object Placement Improvements

## Overview
I've implemented several improvements to make object placement in the map editor much more efficient and user-friendly.

## New Features

### 1. Persistent Object Placement Mode
**Problem Solved**: You no longer need to reselect the object type after each placement.

**How to Use**:
- **Shift + Click** on any object type in the objects panel to toggle persistent mode
- **Shift + M** keyboard shortcut to toggle persistent mode 
- When persistent mode is active, you'll see a yellow "P" indicator in the object panel
- The status bar shows "(Persistent)" after the object type name
- Place as many objects of the same type as you want without reselecting

### 2. Multi-Object Selection
**Problem Solved**: You can now select multiple objects for bulk operations.

**How to Use**:
- **Ctrl + Click** on objects in the map to add them to your selection
- Selected objects show bright selection outlines (primary) and dimmer outlines (secondary)
- The status bar shows "Selected: X objects" when multiple objects are selected

### 3. Copy/Cut/Paste Objects
**Problem Solved**: You can now copy and paste objects to quickly duplicate layouts.

**How to Use**:
- **Ctrl + C**: Copy selected objects to clipboard
- **Ctrl + X**: Cut selected objects (copy + delete)
- **Ctrl + V**: Enter paste mode - click where you want to paste the objects
- **Escape**: Cancel paste mode
- The status bar shows clipboard status and paste mode information
- Objects maintain their relative positions when pasted

### 4. Delete Multiple Objects
**Problem Solved**: Quickly delete multiple objects at once.

**How to Use**:
- Select multiple objects with **Ctrl + Click**
- Press **Delete** key to remove all selected objects
- Or use **Ctrl + X** to cut them (which also deletes them after copying)

### 5. Visual Feedback & Status Information
**New Indicators**:
- Yellow "P" indicator in object panel when persistent mode is active
- Status bar shows current mode: "Placing: ObjectType (Persistent)"
- Status bar shows "Paste Mode: X objects" when in paste mode
- Status bar shows "Selected: X objects" for multi-selection
- Status bar shows "Clipboard: X objects" when objects are copied

## Quick Reference

### Object Panel Controls
- **Click**: Select object type and enter placement mode
- **Shift + Click**: Toggle persistent placement mode
- Visual help text at bottom of panel

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- **Shift + M**: Toggle persistent object placement mode
- **Ctrl + C**: Copy selected objects
- **Ctrl + X**: Cut selected objects  
- **Ctrl + V**: Paste objects (click to place)
- **Delete**: Delete selected objects
- **Escape**: Cancel current mode (placement/paste/selection)

### Mouse Controls (in Objects mode)
- **Left Click**: Place object (placement mode) or select object (selection mode)
- **Ctrl + Left Click**: Add object to multi-selection
- **Right Click**: Cancel placement mode or delete object
- **Right Click** (in paste mode): Cancel paste

## Usage Examples

### Placing Multiple Death Objects
1. Switch to Objects tab
2. **Shift + Click** on "Event" object type (this activates persistent mode)
3. Click on each tile where players can fall off the map
4. Objects will be placed continuously without needing to reselect
5. **Escape** or click another object type to exit placement mode

### Copying Object Layouts
1. **Ctrl + Click** to select multiple objects you want to copy
2. **Ctrl + C** to copy them
3. **Ctrl + V** to enter paste mode
4. Click where you want the copied objects to appear
5. The relative positions will be maintained

### Quick Object Cleanup
1. **Ctrl + Click** to select multiple unwanted objects
2. **Delete** key to remove them all at once

## Technical Implementation
- Added persistent placement mode that doesn't exit after object placement
- Implemented multi-object selection with Ctrl+Click
- Added object clipboard system with copy/paste functionality
- Enhanced visual feedback with selection highlights and status information
- Added keyboard shortcuts for efficient workflow
- Implemented batch operations for undo/redo support

These improvements should make creating levels with many objects (especially "death" zones) much faster and more intuitive!
