# Animation Files Restructuring

The animation files have been successfully reorganized into a more structured directory layout.

## What Changed

### Before
```
data/
├── walk_selection.py
├── walk_selection.json
├── idle_selection.py
├── idle_selection.json
├── jump_selection.py
├── jump_selection.json
├── trans_selection.py
├── trans_selection.json
├── fall_selection.py
├── fall_selection.json
├── __init__.py
└── __pycache__/
```

### After
```
src/
└── animations/
    ├── __init__.py
    └── player/
        ├── __init__.py
        ├── walk_selection.py
        ├── walk_selection.json
        ├── idle_selection.py
        ├── idle_selection.json
        ├── jump_selection.py
        ├── jump_selection.json
        ├── trans_selection.py
        ├── trans_selection.json
        ├── fall_selection.py
        ├── fall_selection.json
        └── __pycache__/
```

## Files Moved

✅ **Moved to `src\animations\player\`:**
- `walk_selection.py` and `walk_selection.json`
- `idle_selection.py` and `idle_selection.json`
- `jump_selection.py` and `jump_selection.json`
- `trans_selection.py` and `trans_selection.json`
- `fall_selection.py` and `fall_selection.json`
- `__init__.py`

✅ **Updated Imports:**
- All imports in `src\utils\assets.py` updated from `data.` to `..animations.player.`
- Relative imports ensure proper module loading within the src package structure

✅ **Preserved Functionality:**
- All animation data remains accessible
- Game functionality unchanged
- Exception handling for missing animations maintained

## Benefits

1. **Better Organization**: Animation files are now grouped logically under `src\animations\player\`
2. **Scalability**: Easy to add other animation categories (enemies, effects, etc.)
3. **Consistency**: Animation data is now part of the main source structure
4. **Modularity**: Clear separation between player animations and other data

## Data Directory Status

The original `data\` directory now only contains:
- `Backup\` - Preserved backup files
- `Old_Animations\` - Preserved old animation files

These can be kept for reference or removed if no longer needed.

## Testing

✅ Game tested and loads successfully with new file structure
✅ All animation imports working correctly
✅ Player animations functional
