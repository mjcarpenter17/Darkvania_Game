- ✅ **Task 4.3**: Show respawn prompt with Space key option
- ✅ **Task 4.4**: Implement level restart and respawn functionality

## Technical Requirements

### Animation Mapping
- **Appear Tele**: Player spawn/teleport in animation
- **Hit**: Player taking damage reaction
- **Death**: Player death animation

### Health System Specifications
- **Initial Health**: 2 HP
- **Damage per Enemy Hit**: 1 HP
- **Invulnerability Duration**: 1.0 seconds after taking damage
- **Health Display**: Top-left corner UI

### Respawn Mechanics
- **Death Condition**: Health ≤ 0
- **Respawn Input**: Space key
- **Respawn Action**: Level restart + spawn animation
- **Spawn Invulnerability**: During "Appear Tele" animation

### Integration Points
- Player spawn system
- Enemy collision detection
- UI health display
- Game state management for death/respawn
- Level restart functionality

## Expected Behaviors
1. Player spawns into map with "Appear Tele" animation
2. Health UI shows current HP (2/2) in top-left corner
3. Player takes 1 damage when colliding with enemies
4. Hit animation plays with 1-second invulnerability
5. Death animation plays when health reaches 0
6. Respawn prompt appears with Space key option
7. Level restarts and player spawns again with animation
